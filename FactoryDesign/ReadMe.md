# Factory Design Pattern

## Overview
The **Factory Design Pattern** is used when there is a **superclass** and multiple **sub-classes**, and we want to create and return an object of a specific sub-class based on given input.

## Advantages

- Focuses on creating objects for the **interface** rather than the **implementation**.
- Promotes **loose coupling** between classes, resulting in more **robust** and **maintainable** code.
